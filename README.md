## Armour Stands
This mod adds an craftable armour stand item (look for "changing model" in the crafting helper [N] or putting together a plank and small nails). 
To update its model according to the set thats inside right click the stand and select "update armour stand". 
The model will not change if there is no item present. 
If you mix items from different sets it will take the model of whichever Item has the lowest Wurm Id sooo... just dont mix 🗡️

Have fun!
